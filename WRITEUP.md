# Ratings and social influence: writeup

Claude writes your answers into the slots below as you say them. You may ask it to change any of
your answers at any time, except the Part 0 predictions. Every `XXXX` in Parts 0 to 5 needs an
answer; the follow-up slots at the end are optional.

**Name:** Owen Blanchard
**Date:** 2026-09-24

## Part 0. Predictions

Answered before anything runs. Claude writes them in as you said them, and they stay as written.

**1. Once people can see the counts, which artist wins most often?** 1. the one who starts with the most downloads, or the first one most people download.

**2. Does inequality rise or fall with social influence?** rise

**3. Does the best artist ever lose a world?** yes

**4. Can a recommender lower inequality without lowering fidelity to true taste?** yes

## Part 1. Users on their own

Code: `part1_independent.py`. Figure: `figures/part1_strip.png`.

**What Gini and unpredictability each show, in your own words:** Gini is a measure of how uneven the artist share is across worlds, unpredictability is a measure of how it changes from world to world, unpredictability measures how the artist share changes across worlds.

**What the figure shows, one sentence:** Then, each artist has a spread of world outcomes, relative to a true outcome diamond

## Part 2. The recommender

Code: `recommender.py`, `part2_recommender.py`. Figure: `figures/part2_strip.png`.

**The capabilities and limitations of `top_five`, in your words:** The top 5 function always provides some 5 most downloaded artists, but how informative this is is limited because if artists have insufficient downloads the list fills randomly. In addition, there is no nuance or recommender happening.

**What Claude corrected in your reading, in your words, or "nothing":** XXXX

**What changed against Part 1, one sentence:** Artists had more highly variable spreads less accurate to their true popularity or share, as well as every artist having "starve" worlds with zero marketshare if they weren't initially chosen at random.

## Part 3. Social influence

Code: `my_choice.py`, `hand_check.py`, `part3_influence.py`. Figures: `figures/part3_gini.png`,
`figures/part3_unpredictability.png`.

**Your rule in your words:** XXXX

**Hand check, before the table: which artist your rule should favor, and by a little or a lot:** XXXX

**Hand check: whether the table matched what you said:** XXXX

**The shape you expect the two curves to have, as you told Claude before the run:** XXXX

**What you changed in your rule, at the hand check or after the run, or "nothing":** XXXX

**What the two curves show against the paper's Figures 1 and 2, in one or two sentences:** XXXX

**Revisited: which of your Part 0 predictions you would now change, and why:** XXXX

## Part 4. Your recommender

Code: `my_recommender.py`, `part4_recommender.py`. Figure: `figures/part4_recommenders.png`.

**Your rule in words, before any code:** XXXX

**What you expect it to do to inequality, unpredictability and fidelity, as you told Claude before the run:** XXXX

**What it bought and what it cost, one sentence:** XXXX

## Part 5. Reflection

**Where this shows up in data you have already handled, or in an interface you use, one sentence:** XXXX

**A moment Claude was wrong or overconfident, or a judgment you kept for yourself, one sentence:** XXXX

## Follow-ups

Optional, and not graded. Nothing under this heading is ever counted as missing: leave a slot as
`XXXX` if you did not do that follow-up.

**What is shown (`followup_shown.py`): which market moved success further from quality:** XXXX

**One assumption (`followup_assumption.py`): the assumption you changed:** XXXX

**One assumption: whether the Part 3 conclusion survived:** XXXX

**Anything else you tried:** XXXX

**Anything else: what it showed:** XXXX
